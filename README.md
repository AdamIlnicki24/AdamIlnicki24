## What is Clasicos?

Clasicos is a neutral meeting place for fans of both Barcelona and Real Madrid.  

- Users can create their all-time best XI from a pool of players stored in our database.  
- If a player they want isn’t available, they can fill out a short suggestion form to request adding that player. Suggestions are emailed directly to the admin.  

## Admin Features

- Ban users for any behavior deemed offensive (prevents them from commenting and recommending).  
- Review and manage all suggestion forms (player additions and corrections), which are emailed to the admin.  
- All other user-submitted data (teams, comments, recommendations) is stored in the database.

## Why This Idea?

I’ve spent 17 years on similar fan sites and watched them evolve rapidly. Rather than build yet another club-specific fan page, I wanted to create a truly neutral space where Polish fans of both Barcelona and Real Madrid could gather.  

Most popular Polish Barcelona and Real Madrid sites have active forums with high posting frequency. Clasicos offers the same—users can post comments and recommend others’ comments. Offensive behavior is policed by admins, who can ban users to keep the community welcoming.

## Branching & Deployment

- **Development**: All work and commits happen on the `dev` branch.
